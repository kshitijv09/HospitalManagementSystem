# HospitalManagementSystem
This Hospital Management System has following functionalities:
1- Admits a Patient
2- Provision for both Emergency and Non-Emergency Admission is there.
3- Prints details of a patient already admitted
4- Discharges a patient
5- Calculates and prints the bill of the discharged patient
6- Sends Ambulance to input address if required.

Assumptions:
1- This hospital has 100 beds available for non-emergency admission but in case of emergency admission, if beds are full, it transfers the patient to a different hospital. Hence, any number of Emergency Admissions can take place.

Input Data:
1- Details of Hospital such as name, address, Doctor count, staff count, bed count,  is already fed into the program.
2- Program reads list of already admitted patients from a text file ( which acts as a database )

Sample Database:
PATIENT_NAME             PATIENT_ID        ROOM_NO                BLOODGRP.                CONTACT_INFO 
Lionel Messi             HMS2022_1            1                      O+                   +91-9435668940 
Neymar Jr.               HMS2022_3            2                      AB+                  +91-8765453345

3- Details will be printed on the screen accordingly.

Program Details:

1- Program has been made while adhering to concepts of Object-Oriented Programming as much as possible.
2- Multiple classes have been used to promote encapsulation and data members and functions have been put in private and       protected scope accordingly to encourage data abstraction.
3- < Patient> Class inherits the Hospital Class.
4- <AvailService> class is a friend of Hospital Class.
5-  <admitPatient> function of class Patient makes use of <bedcount> function of class Bed.
